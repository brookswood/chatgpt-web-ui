# Web UI for ChatGPT

https://assistant.thegptpodcast.app

Ask questions from Open AI’s ChatGPT `gpt-3.5-turbo` engine

## Why?
- No more daily logouts from the playground - OpenAI API key is stored in `localStorage`
- Can be added to the phone’s home screen
- Token-based cost, instead of flat 20$/mo
- No word-by-word output throttling – get all text immediately after generation

## In the future
- Install on your computer as a light-weight Chrome app
- Customize the assistant’s brief in the prompt
